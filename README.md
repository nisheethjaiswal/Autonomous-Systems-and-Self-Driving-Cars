Autonomous Systems and Self-Driving Cars in Carla Simulator


Using the Carla simulator for implementing driverless self-driving cars and autonomous systems using AI algorithms, the APIs for implementing computer vision for following traffic lights, following traffic signals, lane-behaviour using Kalman filters, and finally training the model to perform well in dynamic weather conditions and different maps in the Carla simulator.
